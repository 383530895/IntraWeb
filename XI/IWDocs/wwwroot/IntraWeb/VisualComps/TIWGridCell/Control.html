    <p>The Control property allows insertion of a control into a grid cell. The lifetime of the control remains up to the developer. If the grid is not rerendered, it can be assigned an owner of the form and it will be destroyed when the form is destroyed.</p>
    <p>Controls that are read only and will not cause any form update can be destroyed after they are rendered. An example of this is a TIWURL component which links to another form or page.</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>The features demo demonstrated use of a TIWEdit in a control property in&nbsp;EditGridForm.pas.</p>
