</h2>
    <p>SetURL can be used to associate a URL to the form and set the default URL. Internally SetURL calls TIWURLMap.Add, but also&nbsp;sets the URL as the default. The recorded URL can be obtained by calling <a href="GetURL.html">GetURL
</a>.
</p>
    <p>SetURL can only be called once per form and should be called in the initialization section. If you wish to map multiple URLs to a form, additional URLs can be added using TIWURLMap.Add.
