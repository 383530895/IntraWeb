    <p>TIWAppForm is the base class for all forms used in App Mode.

    <h3>Visual Form Inheritance
</h3>
    <p>VFI&nbsp;it is not&nbsp;supported&nbsp;because of complexities in the VCL, and differing implementations between IDE versions. Some users report that it works fine for&nbsp;them. We have repeatedly tested it in Delphi 2010 and found it to be problematic.
</p>
    <p>Even in&nbsp;VCL forms&nbsp;applications, VFI has many issues that have caused many developers to avoid it. A common problem occurs when making changes to the base form. These changes often cause serious conflicts in the inherited DFM and make the base form de facto read only.
</p>
    <p>Instead of VFI, consider using frames.</p>
