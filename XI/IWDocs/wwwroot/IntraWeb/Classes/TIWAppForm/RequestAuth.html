  <h3>
    class function RequestAuth(aRequest: TWebRequest; var rGroup: string): boolean; 
    virtual;</h3>
  <p>
    RequestAuth allows you to conrol authentication on a form by form basis. To use 
    this functionality, override the class method in your form class. If this method 
    is not overriden, the implied result is controlled by
    <a href="../Authers/TIWAuther/Policy.html">TIWAuther.Policy</a>.</p>
  <h4>
    aRequest</h4>
  <p>
    The raw web request which caused this request.</p>
  <h4>
    rGroup</h4>
  <p>
    rGroup is reserved for future use when the Auther classes are expanded to 
    support groups. Currently this property can be ignored and there is no need to 
    set it and any value in this argument should be ignored</p>
  <h4>
    Result</h4>
  <p>
    True will cause authentication to be required to access this form. False will 
    allow unauthenticated access. </p>
