    <h3>Property ReferringURL: string;
</h3>
    <p>The ReferringURL property contains the URL that&nbsp;referred to the link which started the session.
</p>
    <p>ReferringURL contains the URL of the page that contained the link which started the session. This can be a start URL, or a URL which causes an implicit start. If started from a bookmark, manually, or from the StandAlone debug console, ReferringURL will be blank.
</p>
    <p>While ReferringURL may be better named ReferringStartURL, it was named before ReferringURLLast existed and has been left as is to preserve code compatibility.
