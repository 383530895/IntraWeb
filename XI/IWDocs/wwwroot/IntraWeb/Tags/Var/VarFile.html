    <p>VAR files use the extension #.var. That is for Jack.html a VAR file would be named Jack#.var. The VAR file is a text format containing single line name=value pairs. For example:</p>
    <pre style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">Name=Jack Smith<br>;Acting CEO, but for public we use just CEO
      <br>Title=CEO
    </pre>
    <p>Any line starting with a ; is ignored and treated as a comment. In the future VAR files will optionally be able to use XML as well.</p>
