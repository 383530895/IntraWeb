    <p>Integreated page mode (IPM) is a new feature for IntraWeb XI. It is not the same as the page mode available in earlier versions of IntraWeb. The page mode available in earlier versions of IntraWeb has been deprecated.
</p>
    <p>For years we have wanted to integrate IntraWeb Studio (IWS) and IntraWeb. We had always assumed this would happen mostly in IWS and giving it abilities to consume and integreate IW. However with XI, in fact the reverse is occuring. IWS functionality is being implemented in IPM.
