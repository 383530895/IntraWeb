    <title>Custom Visual Components
</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>This should be an interesting topic. Developers have long since asked for documentation on writing custom components, and it is an important topic both for developers and for the livelihood of IntraWeb. IntraWeb XI made a huge move to clean up internal code by eliminating umPartial, 3.2, WAP, .NET, and Linux code. However to remain compatible, some code even after cleanup remains more complex than we would like due to previous design constraints.
</p>
    <p>Status
</p>
    <p>Starting with IntraWeb XII, we will begin to change the custom component structure carefully. We will update these topics as we can for XI, however they may not be complete before the changes in XII commence. Many classes are still split into multiple levels and later will be merged.

    <h3>What is a visual component?
</h3>
    <p>A visual component is an IntraWeb component that may be a control, or component but generates HTML, and/or Javascript into an IntraWeb form.
</p>
    <h3>Important Classes and Concepts
</h3>
    <h3>Quirk Mode
</h3>
    <p>HTML output still depends on IE Quirk Mode. In the past we had no choice but to use Quirk Mode.&nbsp;We plan to remove this in XII, however changing this will require a lot of testing.
