    <p>There are three basic types of visual components.</p>
    <h4>Components</h4>
    <p>Components do not have a design time render other than a component place holder. Components do not have an x, y positioning. Examples include TIWTimer.</p>
    <h4>Controls</h4>
    <p>Controls render themselves with a placeholder at design time. Examples include TIWEdit, TIWGrid, TIWLabel, etc.</p>
    <h4>Containers</h4>
    <p>Containers contain other components. Examples include the form itself, and regions.</p>
    <h3>Capabilities</h3>
    <p>Components support a variety of capabilities. Capabilites are not exclusive, and are often combined.</p>
    <h4>Rendering</h4>
    <p>All components must support the ability to render. That is, output HTML and/or Javascript.</p>
    <p>Many components are render only.&nbsp;Examples of&nbsp;render only components&nbsp;are TIWLabel and TIWMemo.</p>
    <h4>Submit</h4>
    <p>Submit components can be used to send data back to the server. Examples include links and buttons.</p>
    <h4>Input</h4>
    <p>Input components return a value. Examples include TIWEdit, TIWListbox, and TIWCheckbox.</p>
