    <h3>
      Per Developer</h3>
    <p>
      CrossTalk is licensed per developer, not per machine. This means that if you 
      purchase a CrossTalk license &quot;1 Developer&quot;, CrossTalk may be used by a single 
      developer. That single developer may install CrossTalk on multiple machines, but 
      CrossTalk can only be used by that single developer.</p>
