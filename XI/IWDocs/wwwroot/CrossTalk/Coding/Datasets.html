    <p>CrossTalk can allow you to access .NET DataSets.
</p><p>Here is a DataSet with a DataTable declared in Visual Studio.
</p><p><img src="../index_files\20090610-DataSet.jpg" border="0"></p><p>Now with CrossTalk we can easily access this DataSet.
</p><p><img src="../index_files\20090610-DelphiCode.jpg" border="0"></p><p>Note that the Row[i] needs to be typecasted. This is true in .NET as well because Row[i] returns a DataRow, not a CountryRow. I decided that this was also a good example to show that you can cast objects as needed to descendant types just as you can in .NET.
</p><p>You can also access the properly typed version by using the Items (also set as the default indexer) property instead and eliminate the need for typecasting.

</h3><p>In the future (Version 2.0 or later) we plan to also create VCL dataset connector that will allow you to bind Delphi databound controls to .NET DataSets.</p>
