<p><font face="Arial" size="5"><b>Step 1</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If you look at the source to the previous page, you will
see that it is a static HTML page with no difference than the regular HTML
pages, except for the extension.</font> <font face="Arial">The contents is
generated by associating the IWP extension (this can be any extension you want)
with a server-side ISAPI (or DSO) application which is developed using exsiting
technology in Delphi such as WebBroker, in combination with IntraWeb. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The difference is that IWP's allow you to insert IW
controls represented by tags (either the standard IW tag which is
{%ControlName%} or using Borland tags) and the associated server-side
application will replace these tags. So far, this may sound similar to what was
offered with normal PageMode applications in previous versions of IW, however,
the significant change is the following header inside the web-page:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>&lt;intraweb:header&gt;<br>
FormName=FormStep1<br>
Handler=NotNeededInThisCase <br>
&lt;/intraweb:header&gt;</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The following button has been replaced by the IWP
application:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">{%IWButton321%}</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">When you click it, the label below will display the
current date:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">{%IWLabel321%}</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
In this case, the FormName since it is present in the header section will
be used. Otherwise it would search for the Handler. The Handler corresponds to the WEBACTION
defined in the WebModule (if present).
